                    Pong is exactly and purely what it first stated: a classic game, with a - humble - twist of my own. Originaly was planned more features, but for a matter of MVP and cronogram, some had to be cut out. I plan to add those as I gain more experience and have more time. I hope you like it ;)<br/>
                    <span class="smallLetters">Important to say here that it wasnÂ´t intended by any way to copy any other games out there. <span class="twistFont">Twist</span> Pong was made only and purely for recreational/educational, non-commercial use</span>
